# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

# 
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025
# 
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
# numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
